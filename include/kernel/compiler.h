/// Consider the following abstract model of the system:
/// @code
///             :                :
/// +-------+   :   +--------+   :   +-------+
/// | CPU 1 |<----->| Memory |<----->| CPU 2 |
/// +-------+   :   +--------+   :   +-------+
///     ^       :       ^        :       ^
///     |       :       |        :       |
///     |       :       v        :       |
///     |       :   +--------+   :       |
///     +---------->| Device |<----------+
///             :   +--------+   :
///             :                :

/// Each CPU executes a program that generates memory access operations. In the
/// abstract CPU, memory operation ordering is very relaxed, and a CPU may actually
/// perform the memory operations in any order it likes, provided program causality
/// appears to be maintained. Similarly, the compiler may also arrange the
/// instructions it emits in any order it likes, provided it doesn't affect the
/// apparent operation of the program.
///
/// So in the above diagram, the effects of the memory operations performed by a
/// CPU are perceived by the rest of the system as the operations cross the
/// interface between the CPU and rest of the system (the dotted lines).
